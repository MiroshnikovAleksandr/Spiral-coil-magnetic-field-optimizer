# Spiral-coil-magnetic-field-optimizer
Optimizer of planar spiral coils' turn distribution to achieve uniform magnetic field
### Instructions
* Specify the geometric and electrical parameters of your desired coil in _parameters.toml_.
* Open _Genetic_circular.py_, _Genetic_rectangle.py_ or _Genetic_piece.py_  if you want to optimize a coil of circular, rectangular of piecewise-linear geometry respectively.
* Uncomment the last paragraph of code and run the script.
* You can add functions from _Plot.py_ if you want to further visualize your results.
* You can use functions from _Resistance.py_ if you want to get more information about your coil or split the coil into parallel circuits.
